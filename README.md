JV Master Countdown is a minimalist, animated “coming soon” website that tracks the countdown to the completion of my master’s thesis.
Built with React + Vite, the project combines a soft color palette, scroll animations, and responsive design to create a digital diary of my research journey.
This site serves as both a personal milestone tracker and a creative outlet — merging design, storytelling, and technology.
It reflects the evolving process of my master’s work while providing visitors with a glimpse into my academic and creative journey.
